## A talk on JavaScript Promises

JavaScript is an asynchronous language; it is designed to react to events and to trigger jobs that take an unknown amount of time to complete. While there is a fairly standard way to call functions when something happens, until recently there had been no standard way to chain these functions together, nor an easy way to handle failures inside the chain. Promises provide the solution. This talk will guide the group through the motivation for Promises, how they work, and what comes next (async/await and beyond).
